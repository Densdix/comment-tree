Regular expression for finding comments (default: `//.*|/\\*[\\s\\S]*?\\*/|<!--[\\s\\S]*?-->`)

### `commentExplorer.fileExtensions`

Array of file extensions to include in scanning (default includes popular languages)

### `commentExplorer.exclude`

Array of exclusion patterns for files and folders. By default, excludes common directories and files that don't contain user comments:

- `**/node_modules/**` - Node.js dependencies
- `**/dist/**`, `**/build/**`, `**/out/**` - Build outputs
- `**/.git/**`, `**/.vscode/**` - Version control and IDE files
- `**/.next/**`, `**/.nuxt/**`, `**/.cache/**` - Framework caches
- `**/coverage/**`, `**/*.min.js`, `**/*.map` - Generated/test files

Example settings:

```json
{
  "commentExplorer.regex": "//.*|#.*|--.*|/\\*[\\s\\S]*?\\*/",
  "commentExplorer.fileExtensions": ["js", "ts", "py", "java"],
  "commentExplorer.exclude": ["**/node_modules/**", "**/dist/**", "**/.git/**"]
}
```
